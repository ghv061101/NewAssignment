# NewAssignment

A small workspace containing a React + Vite frontend and a directory for data-structures & algorithm (DSA) practice problems.

## Project Overview

This repository is organized to keep a lightweight frontend app (built with React and Vite) separate from algorithm practice code under `DSA/`.

## Repository Structure

- `Frontend/` — React + Vite app (source in `src/`, config and scripts included).
- `DSA/` — small JavaScript files with algorithm examples and exercises (runnable with Node.js).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or a compatible Node version).

## Frontend — Setup & Run

1. Install dependencies:

```
cd Frontend
npm install
```

2. Run development server (Vite):

```
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

4. Preview a production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

5. Lint code:

```
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

- Frontend live demo: https://ghvdatatable.netlify.app/ (hosted on Netlify)


## DSA — Running examples

Example files are plain JavaScript and can be executed with Node.js. For example:

```
node DSA/problem.js
```

The `DSA/problem.js` file contains a sample function and a few `console.log` calls demonstrating output.
